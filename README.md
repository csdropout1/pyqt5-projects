# pyqt5-projects
**Creating meme applications and games to learn/practice the most popular GUI library in python.**

## Applications:
*Creator Note: *

If you want to convert any of my python files into an actual executable, use the following:
~~pip install pyinstaller~~ *Skip if you already have this*
pyinstaller main.py

### Instameme:
**Located in 'instameme'**
Feeling bored? Try this program out! 시간을 낭비하는 것보다 낫어! Go crazy, send it as a risky text. Idk..
*Other Notes:*
*Application comes with the default setting of the 'do you like me?' meme.*
*Variable are set at the top of the class for you to alter as necessary.*
*As always, read the **REQUIREMENTS.TXT** file to find all the required python packages needed to run main.py.*

### Line 5
**Located in 'Line_5'**
Got bored of Connect4? Mix it up with Line 5 - played on a classic Connect4 board with much simpler rules. 
Get 5 in a line to win, Connect4 is a solved game, technically Line 5 is also a solved game too ~ but why not
play for fun instead of learning all the theory this time? ㅋㅋ The optimal strategy is a little bit different.
Have fun learning - once you figure out this game (like Connect4), you won't be able to enjoy it ever again!

*Other Notes:*
*The variable w could be change to make this Line4 or Line6, etc ~ not too sure how fun that might be though...*
*As always, read the **REQUIREMENTS.TXT** file to find all the required python packages needed to run main.py.*
